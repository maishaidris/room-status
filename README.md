# SON Room Status Application

The purpose of this application is to provide a status for each conference and classroom in the SON building.  If a user discovers something is amiss with one of these rooms, the user can easily notify IT about the issue.  The application simplifies the process of letting the IT department know about the error.  The status of each ticket is also readily available, increasing the transparency between SON and its clients.

This was a few months of effort with the IT department at the University of Rochester's School of Nursing (SON).  The final version of this is integrated with & running within SON's intranet network.  The version committed to GitHub is up for posterity's sake.

This application was built with Django, Bootstap, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.
